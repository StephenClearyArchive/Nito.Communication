# Nito.Communication

A library for lower-level communications. Includes classes for working with sockets and serial ports, with orthogonal classes for designing protocols.

## Current State

Nito.Communication is in a pre-release (pre-Alpha) state. Source code may be downloaded, but don't expect stability at this point. :)

## Future Directions

Nito.Communication will consist of the following pieces:
- EAP TCP/IP socket wrappers (migrated from Nito.Async).
- EAP serial port wrappers.
- Common reusable protocol classes, suitable for use with EAP or TAP components.

Target platforms include:
- Desktop .NET 3.0
- Desktop .NET 4.0
- Silverlight 3/4
- Compact Framework 3.5
